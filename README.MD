# Conekta checkout example

This is just a minimum example of how to implement the *CONEKTA* api with NodeJS.
I did this for a personal prpject and tought it may be helpfull to others. The repo will not be regularly updated. Please fell free to fork and improve the code. 

#Usage

1. Clone the repo and `cd` into it
2. Run `npm install`
3. You will need to create a .env file at the root of the project with your dev secret key
4. Change also the public key at /views/index.pug
5. If everything is ok you should be able to run the server with `node app.js`

Note: I recommend using `nodemon` to run the server for convenience.
